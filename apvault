Usage: apvault.sh <subcommand> <path> [options]
Make sure you review definitions/bannedKeywords.lst to fit your needs, it is very opinionated by default!

Examples:
apvault.sh lint-roll <path> [--dry-run]		Deletes unwanted files/folders, see definitions in bannedKeywords.lst and derivedContent.lst.

apvault.sh flatten <path> [--dry-run]    Removes folders like 'Videos/' or 'Pictures/' and brings content up one level.

apvault.sh decompress <path>			Recursively decompresses all .zip, .rar, .7z archives in the path.

apvault.sh ingest <path>			Decompresses, lint-rolls, copies files into the vault. Will prompt for vault location.
						Leave a trailing slash '/' in the path to copy path contents, rather than the path.

apvault.sh copy-images <path> <target path>	Copies all images in path into your images path, keeping the directory structure.
						Leave a trailing slash '/' in the path to copy path contents, rather than the path.
						Good for migrating into a Videos + Images structure for your collection.
